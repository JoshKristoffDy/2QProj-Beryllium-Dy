			<h2> Introduction </h2>
			
			<p id = "intro"> Fire Emblem is a very diverse game in terms of mechanics, with some mechanics being the staple of the franchise while others are limited to certain entries. <br>
				In this part of my low-budget website, I will try to explain the various basic mechanics that can be seen as a staple throughout the franchise. <br>
				These may or may not include: Moving, Trading, Terrain, Weapon Triangle and Permadeath. So without further ado, let us begin. </p>

		<article id = "permadeath">
			
			<h3> Permadeath </h3>
			
			<img src = "images/permadeath.jpg" id = "permadeath_1">
			
			<p id = "permadeath_2"> The infamous mechanic that defined Fire Emblem as a franchise. No matter who you ask in the community, they will reply in the same way. <br>
				Permadeath truly is one of the mechanics that define Fire Emblem. For those who don't know, Permadeath is a feature which is pretty much summed up in one sentence: <br>
				"If a unit dies, they're gone forever". Unlike most tactics games that have fallen units revived by the next chapter, if one of your units HP drops to 0, that's that. <br>
				In my honest opinion, this forces players to be even more efficient in strategizing, along with giving you that feeling of immersion and attachment with your units. </p>
			
			<! It doesn't change the fact that I have spent LITERAL HOURS JUST TO CLEAR A MAP EFFICIENTLY BECAUSE OF PERMADEATH! >

		<article id = "movement">
			
			<h3> Movement </h3>
			
			<img src = "images/Movement.jpg" id = "movement_1">
			
			<p id = "movement_2"> One of the simplest mechanics in any Tactics game. Every time you select a character during your turn, you can move them a number of spaces in any direction, <br>
				that is, for as long as the unit still has extra movement. Basically the game looks at a unit's movement value N, then just lets your unit move in any direction N times. <br>
				Some units have better movement values than others, an example being 'mounted' units that ride on horses, wyverns or pegasi. Oh and one more thing before I end this section, <br>
				some units can move in specific terrains, while other units are debilitated or even stopped by specific terrains. </p>
			
			<! Don't get me started on how mounted units are better though. Just don't. >

		<article id = "terrain">
			
			<h3> Terrains </h3>
			
			<img src = "images/Throne.png" id = "terrain_1">
			
			<p id = "terrain_2"> Another staple and in my opinion, one of the most frustrating and fun mechanics in the entirety of the franchise. Terrains in Fire Emblem can work in different ways. <br>
			    These differ from giving buffs to any unit that lands on them, hindering the progress of units, some of them can even restore health! A very iconic example of this is Fire Emblem's Throne. <br>
				A Throne in Fire Emblem can give any unit standing on it a higher chance of dodging enemy attacks, a defense buff of three, and top top it all off, health regeneration. <br>
				An example of terrian that can hinder the progress of units are mountains. Mountains can easily hinder the movement of ground units, with units on horseback not being able to move through them at all! <br>
				Although this is the case, flying units seem to be unbothered by these kind of terrain. My point is that specific units are more advantageous in specific terrains, and that you should keep this in mind while playing Fire Emblem. </p>
			
			<! ...and depending on the game, terrain bonuses are either negligible or outright cancerous. >

		<article id = "trade">
			
			<h3> Trading </h3>
			
			<img src = "images/Trade.png" id = "trade_1">
			
			<p id = "trade_2"> Trading. Definitely something you wouldn't want to overlook when you're playing Fire Emblem. Do you have a unit in need of an extra weapon? A unit who just used up all of their healing items? <br>
				Or do you just want to give another unit a good weapon in order to destroy their foes? All of this can be done with the simple act of trading. This command allows you to exchange a unit's inventory <br>
				in order to exchange items as long as the units in question are adjacent to each other. Make sure to make use of this in tough situations! </p>
			
			<! Extremely useful. >

		<article id = "attack">
			
			<h3> Attacking </h3>
			
			<img src = "images/Attacking.png" id = "attack_1">
			
			<p id = "attack_2"> You may be wondering why I'm telling you about one of the simplest commands in all of the Tactics genre but...hear me out. Attacking in Fire Emblem is a lot more complicated than you think. <br>
				Once you command a unit to attack another unit, it shows a complete forecast on how much damage the attack will deal, how likely it is to hit, and how likely the attack will land a critical hit. <br>
				All of this is included within the forecast...along with the statistics of the counter-attack the enemy will do after your attack. This counter-attack doesn't happen if you use ranged weapons though. </p> 
			
			<! Way too basic, although the forecast spices things up. >

		<article id = "weapontriangle">
			
			<h3> Weapon Triangle </h3>
			
			<img src = "images/Weapon Triangle.png" id = "weapontriangle_1">
			
			<p id = "weapontriangle_2"> The Weapon Triangle. This is a mechanic that has been refined over the years, revised over and over again in the sixteen games Fire Emblem has, but the original one is all you need to know. <br>
				Axes beat Lances, Lances beat Swords, and Swords beat Axes. As long as you remember this triangle by heart, you should be able to strategize more efficently while playing Fire Emblem. <br>
				In most games, the weapon triangle gives wepaons with advantage a higher chance to hit and weapons with disadvantage a lower chance to hit. Some games also had an attack buff to weapons with advantage. <br>
				There are also weapon triangles on Fire Emblem's magic system, but that triangle has been revised over and over to the point that it's just different in each game. <br>
				So yes, as long as you learn the basic weapon triangle by heart, you should be able to adapt to the many changes to it as you play through the games. </p>
			
			<! I swear. The magic triangle pisses me off to immeasurable lengths. >

			<p id = "outro"> That's about it for my Basic Mechanics section. I may haven't delved into the other mechanics, but that's mainly because I truly consider those as advanced. <br>
				So yeah, move on to the Advanced Mechanics section if you wish to see these other mechanics. See you there! </p>
