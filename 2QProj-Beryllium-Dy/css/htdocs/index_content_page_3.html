			<h2> Introduction </h2>
			
			<p> So, you probably have all the basics down, strategizing your way to victory with your units. But sometimes you may wonder to yourself, "How many mechanics does the game not teach us?" <br>
				That, my friend, is what I'll be discussing in this part of the website. In this website, I will show you how to gain supports and how to execute rescue chains, the essential advanced mechanics. </p>

			<h3> The Support System </h3>
				
			<img src = "images/Support.jpg" id = "Support">
			
			<p> Ah yes, the support system. It is a staple mechanic in the franchise...although most of the games don't really 'teach' you how the support system works. <br>
				In a matter of fact, I don't even know how the support system works in the modern games! For you see, just like a lot of mechanics in Fire Emblem, the support system also had its fair share of changes. <br>
				Before I delve into some examples though, I think it's much better to talk about what supports even do. So imagine this, you find two units that might be a good couple. <br>
				After messing around the preparation screen, you come across a screen that tells you the 'compatibility' of units and see that the two units are compatible with wach other. <br>
				This means that the two units can engage in 'support conversations'. Support conversations can range from just friendly banter to an all-out backstory reveal that won't be revealed by any other means. <br>
				After a support conversation has been completed, the 'support level' between these two units will increase. </p>
			
			<h4> Support Levels </h4>
			
			<p>	To put it bluntly, support levels are mostly there for the buffs. <br>
				If the units that had a support conversation are near each other in the field, they will give each other buffs which would range from attack buffs to critical chance buffs. <br> 
				In most games, there are three support levels (C, B and A) while some of the modern games have four (C, B, A and S). Aside from buffs, support levels can also decide whether or not the pair will have a relationship or not. <br>
				Well...most of the time anyways. Sometimes support levels are just there to show you how two units get along. </p>			
			
			<h4> How to obtain Support Levels </h4>
			
			<p> As I said before, the way in order to obtain support levels vary from game to game. So I can't really give my advice here. <br>
				All I can tell you is to research on what game you're planning to play so that you won't miss out on the support conversations that truly matter. <br>
				Except...yeah, some of the older games had a maximum amount of times a unit can have support conversations, which is five. <br>
				My main takeaway is that you should be careful in choosing which unit will support with whcih in the older games, and don't forget supports exist for those sweet buffs! </p>
			
			<! The support system is...something. For something so large in scale, I'm actually surprised it wasn't outright explained in the older games. >

			<h3> Secret Shops </h3>
			
			<img src = "images/Secret.png" id = "Secret">
			
			<p> Secret Shops are...well...secret. Which is probably the reason why they're almost impossible to come by without a guide. Partner this with some very vague in-game mechanics in order to get into the shops, secret shops truly are 'secret'. <br>
				First of all, not all of the games have secret shops, I'm just putting this out to let you know that they exist, and that the loot you can get in said shops are extremely valuable for any part of the game. <br>
				So, how do you get in secret shops in the first place? First of all...you get a Member Card, an item that serves as a key to unlock secret shops. <br>
				These member cards are hard to obtain and even harder to track down which chapter has them, so I just recommend for you to look up a separate guide. To make things worse, secret shops are also extremely hidden. <br>
				They can be...pretty much anywhere really, since there's nothing that could differentiate it from other terrain, so I also recommend looking up a guide on the locations of these Secret Shops. </p>
			
			<! Yup, you really should look up a guide if you really wanna get those sweet rare items. >

			<h3> Rescuing </h3>
			
			<img src = "images/Rescue.png" id = "Rescue">
			
			<p> One of my favorite Fire Emblem mechanics, they removed this mechanic back at Fire Emblem 11 though, but this mechanic will be extremely helpful if you want to take on the older games. <br>
				In layman's terms, rescuing is a command a unit can execute in order to 'carry' a unit smaller than themselves. Most players use this mechanic in order to carry units over long distances, <br>
				along with saving units that are low on health. The rescue mechanic is also different between the many games that have it. In some games, a unit with a higher Con value can carry units with lower a Con value, <br>
				while in other games, it depends on a unit's Weight value. The main takeaway from this mechanic is that it's just extremely useful overall in strategizing and that you should consider these when playing the old games. </p>
		
			<! Rescue chains can save lives, especially if your main character is extremely underleveled. >
