				Hello and welcome to my website!!! This website will just give you the fundamentals you need in order to start one of my favorite franchises, Fire Emblem. <br>
				Fire Emblem is a popular turn-based tactical RPG video franchise developed by Intelligent Systems, and published by Nintendo over many platforms. <br>
				A mechanic that separates Fire Emblem from most tactical RPGs is 'permadeath', which means that when a character dies, they don't revive, forcing the player to be careful. <br>
				This website of mine will act as a little 'guide' of sorts for new players that are willing to tackle the franchise in its entirety, which would include where to begin, and where to go from there. <br>
				In fact, the image above and the audio playing are actually from the very first Fire Emblem game for the NES (or Famicom, depends on the region)! 
			</p>
			
			<! Yes, I love Fire Emblem so much that I decided to use it as my topic for my website.>

				<! The OG Main Theme. Had a lot of remakes over the course of sixteen games, but if you listen closely, they still follow the same tune. >
