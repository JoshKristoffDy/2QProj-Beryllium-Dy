				Now it is finally time for me to talk about the games themselves...for you see, there are currently sixteen games in the franchise. Sixteen. Games.<br>
				Although this may seem daunting for a new player, worry not, for I will try and recommend which game you should start with. <br>
				I guess if you want to start playing the more modern Fire Emblems right off the bat, you can start with Fire Emblem Awakening for the 3ds. <br>
				Awakening is somewhat a good Fire Emblem game overall...except for the fact that some of the mechanics in this game don't really carry over <br>
				to the next games. A reason why I think that this is a good starter game is due to the fact that it has 'Casual Mode', a mode where instead of <br>
				the standard 'permadeath' mechanic, characters that die will come back for the next level, which is good for newcomers that are still learning <br>
				the ropes of the series. Overall, you should start with Fire Emblem Awakening if you want to play the modern games earlier, if you don't want <br>
				to experience the pain that is permadeath, or simply because you just want a simple experience. By the way, if you are in need of a Nintendo 3ds <br>
				emulator, I suggest Citra, which you can download <a href = "https://citra-emu.org/"> here. </a>

				After playing Awakening, I suggest playing Sacred Stones for the Gameboy Advance, mainly because it is quite literally just a good transition game overall if you want to play the franchise <br>
				in its entirety, and I have to say...that's a lot of games to cover. Although I DO suggest Sacred Stones as a transition game, I don't really recommend players to start with it since the game <br>
				has literally no tutorial whatsoever as to what to do...and yeah, it's extremely confusing if you don't know what you're doing, without further ado, let's move forward to the next game.

			<! Brief Disclaimer: I haven't played Awakening yet, but I know enough in order to reccomend it. >

			<p id = "Blazing_Sword_2">
				For my second recommendation for a good game to start the franchise, there's Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword for the Gameboy Advance, more commonly known in the States 
				as just Fire Emblem, simply because this game was the first ever game in the franchise that was released outside of Japan. It is because of this fact that I suggest this 
				Fire Emblem game to newcomers. Since this is the first game in the franchise released overseas, the Japanese made sure that people overseas would enjoy the game. This is where 
				the <br> ten-chapter 'tutorial campaign' comes in. This tutorial campaign teaches newcomers the basics of Fire Emblem as well as many useful mechanics that you can transfer into 
				other games in the franchise such as the weapon triangle, terrain buffs, and others. I still have no idea why the hell they didn't really teach the player more about 
				support conversations at this point, but I guess that's fine. Overall, start with Fire Emblem for the Gameboy Advance if you want to play the franchise in its entirety, 
				if you want to learn about basic strategy and mechanics that will help you along the way, and if you're a fan of pixelized graphics and smooth animations. Also, if you 
				require a Gameboy Advance emulator, I suggest VisualBoyAdvance which you can download <a href = "https://sourceforge.net/projects/vba/"> here. </a>

				After playing Blazing Sword, I once again suggest playing Sacred Stones again since it quite literally is just a good transition game. There's also Binding Blade, the game that was released <br>
				before Blazing Blade that acts like a sequel to Blazing Blade. Sure Binding Blade can be...weird, at times, but it's pretty good. Then there is Path of Radiance, if you can afford it, <br>
				the reason as to why I will be talking about right now.
				
				<! Had to experiment here and there to finally be satisfied with the proportions...hehe. >

			<! I swear. This one image took up way too much time to style, probably because it was more on the taller side than the wider side. >
			
			<p id = "PoR_2">
				For my last recommendation...I have Path of Radiance for the Gamecube. Path of Radiance is the first game in the franchise that features voice-acting as well as <br>
				the very first Fire Emblem game to gain 3d graphics. As I said earlier, the main hurdle Fire Emblem newcomers are gonna have if they want to play Path of Radiance <br>
				is due to its extremely high price and scarcity, I mean...you COULD also use a Gamecube emulator, but good luck with that. If you want to start your Fire Emblem <br>
				experience with a bang, you should definitely play Path of Radiance. Also, if you played Super Smash Bros and mained Ike for a while, this is a good opportunity to <br>
				know his story in the games. Overall, it's a good game, it also teaches the fundamentals of Fire Emblem, even though it's not as in-depth as Blazing Sword. So yeah, <br>
				start with Path of Radiance if you have the money to afford it and/or you managed to make it work on an emulator, and if you want a challenging game right off the bat <br>
				Also yeah, if you DID decide to just emulate it, you can get the Dolphin emulator for emulating the Gamecube and the Wii <a href = "https://dolphin-emu.org/"> here. </a>

				So...yeah, that's all I can suggest. After Path of Radiance, you should go for Radiant Dawn though since it is quite literally a sequel to Path of Radiance. Other than that, <br>
				I have nothing else to suggest to you in order for you to begin this journey in the wonderful franchise that is Fire Emblem, so I suggest you continue to the Mechanics pages. <br>
				See you there!!!
